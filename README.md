Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer with a vast array of knowledge in many different front-end and back-end languages and databases.
My objective is simply to be the best web developer I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do.
I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning from seasoned developers.
I studied Engineer, and I believe that my understanding of working as a team are skills that will contribute to my overall success as a developer.
